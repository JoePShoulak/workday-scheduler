# workday-scheduler
A homework assignment for the UMN Coding Bootcamp. This app is a Workday Scheduler. 

## About
This app is meant to be able to glance at your day. With colors, you are able to tell what timeslots are in the past, future, or are happening right now. 

You can add tasks/events to the hourly sections, and you can save that persistent data (reloading will *not* lose the data).
